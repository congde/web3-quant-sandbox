"""Compile a validated strategy source string into an ``on_tick`` callable.

Per ADR-0007, this is the missing bridge between the static DSL safelist /
validator and an *executable* strategy. The backtest engine and the live
runtime both need the SAME ``on_tick(ctx, candle) -> OrderIntent | None``
callable; until now both fell back to a hard-coded harness
(``backtest_service.make_harness_strategy`` / ``strategies_runtime.
_buy_once_strategy``) because no compile step existed. This module is that
step — the single place user / LLM strategy code becomes runnable.

Trust model
-----------
``compile_strategy`` runs the strategy source via ``exec`` in the *current
process*. That is the same trust posture the backtest engine already has
when it invokes a strategy callable — it must be, because ``on_tick`` is
called once per candle and a per-tick subprocess hop is not viable. The
defense is therefore static + a restricted execution namespace:

  1. :func:`validate_strategy_code` rejects denied imports / builtins /
     attributes / eval / exec BEFORE we ever ``exec`` (defense layer 2).
  2. The exec namespace's ``__builtins__`` strips ``DENIED_BUILTINS`` and
     installs a guarded ``__import__`` that resolves only the safelist —
     defense in depth, catching anything the AST pass missed.

Heavyweight process isolation (Docker, ADR-0005) remains the runtime
*deployment* boundary; it wraps the whole runner, orthogonal to this
per-tick compile.
